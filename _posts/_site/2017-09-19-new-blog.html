<p>This blog is an updated version of my old edgy, teenage-years blog at <a href="http://exsubstantia.com">exsubstantia.com</a>.
I kept a somewhat similar style because I like the way Exsubstantia looks, but I hope that the difference in content
will speak for itself.</p>

<p>I will use this blog to talk mostly about two things:</p>

<ol>
  <li>interesting concepts that I come across when working on my research and projects</li>
  <li>interesting stuff that I come across when traveling around</li>
</ol>

<p>but Iâ€™ll try to keep it varied, and also talk about other interesting things. 
I will try to include code whenever necessary, but for more complex projects you can check out <a href="https://github.com/danielegrattarola">my Github</a>.
You can also find me on <a href="https://twitter.com/riceasphait">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/riceasphait/">Instagram</a> as @riceasphait.</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>
