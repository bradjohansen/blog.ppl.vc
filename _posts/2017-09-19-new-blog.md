![Australian Outback (ph. Daniele Grattarola)]({{ site.url }}/images/header/header.jpg)

This blog is an updated version of my old edgy, teenage-years blog at <a href="exsubstantia.com">exsubstantia.com</a>.
I kept a somewhat similar style because I like the way Exsubstantia looks, but i hope that the difference in content
will speak for itself.

I will use this blog to talk mostly about two things: 

1. Interesting concepts that I come across when working on my research and projects
2. Interesting stuff that I come across when traveling around

but I'll try to keep it varied and also talk about other interesting things. 
I will try to include code whenever necessary, but for more complex projects you can check out [my Github](https://github.com/danielegrattarola).
You can also finde me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/riceasphait) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/riceasphait/) as @riceasphait.

Cheers,
Daniele
