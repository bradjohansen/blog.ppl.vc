## What is deep learning?

- Introduction: representation learning, neural networks
- Convolution, recurrence

## What is geometric deep learning?

- Applying deep learning techniques to non-euclidean spaces
    - Classic deep learning is a particular case of this setting
- Signal theory on graphs: most of the same concepts defined on non-euclidean spaces
- Convolution: spectral and spatial approaches
- Recurrence: based on convolution

## Interesting applications

- Single-graph
    - Semi-supervised node classification (Kipf)
    - Multi-graph recommendation system (Monti)
- Multi-graph
    - Generic graph classification/regression (show some examples)
    - Molecule generation (GraphVAE, GraphGAN)

## Current research direction (a.k.a my PhD)

- Change and anomaly detection: one-class classification with autoencoders
- Diagnostics: idenfify the cause of failures
- Control: keep a system in its nominal state through geometric DRL
